# MLOps Project Structure

This repository implements a full MLOps workflow, organized by the following stages:

1. Data Engineering & Ingestion
2. Experimentation & Model Development
3. Model Validation & Testing
4. Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)
5. Monitoring & Observability
6. Model Updates & Retraining
7. Governance, Security & Compliance

Each stage has a dedicated folder with a README describing its purpose, key activities, and recommended tools.

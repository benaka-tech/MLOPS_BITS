# Experimentation & Model Development (Health Insurance)

Iterative process from problem definition to model training and optimization for health insurance applications.

## Key Activities
- Exploratory data analysis, feature selection (e.g., claims features, member demographics)
- Data splitting, model training, evaluation (e.g., fraud detection, risk scoring, churn prediction)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Version control of models, datasets, scripts

## Tools
- MLflow / Weights & Biases
- DVC

## Example Use Case
- Training models to predict fraudulent claims or member churn.
